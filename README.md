# issues

This is a "meta-repository" that aggregates the various active "good first issue" and "help wanted" labeled github issues across all open-source `RTradeLtd` code-bases. The idea is by providing a central repository of information, it is easier for developers to find areas to contribute code via existing github issues. Additionally, if you are unsure where to submit a "feature request", this would be a good place to do it.

Each of our open-source repositories that has open-work available will have a dedicated issue in `RTradeLtd/issues` (this repository). Within each of those "meta-issues" is where you can see different tasks up for grabs, and indicate that you are interested in working on a particular task.

# Process For Taking An Issue And Working On It

* Make sure no one else is currently working on the issue. If someone has expressed interest, and after being engaged there is no response for 2 weeks, feel free to express your interest as well.
* Express your interest in working on a particular issue. To do this, please leave a comment indicating your interest.
* If you don't need any guidance on work involved in an issue, feel free to get started right away
* If you do need some assistance, wait for a project maintainer to get back to you.

## Guidelines

* All submissions MUST include tests, they will not be accepted otherwise
* Do not worry about updating your comments in the issues here after completing a particular task, a repository maintainer will handle curating comments, and closed issues.
