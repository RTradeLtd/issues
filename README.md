# issues

This is a "meta-repository" that aggregates the various active "good first issue" and "help wanted" labeled github issues across all open-source `RTradeLtd` code-bases. The idea is by providing a central repository of information, it is easier for developers to find areas to contribute code via existing github issues. Additionally, if you are unsure where to submit a "feature request", this would be a good place to do it.

The rest of the readme will contain headers denoting a particular repository, such as `Pay`, along with current "up for grabs" issues.
