# issues

This is a "meta-repository" that aggregates the various active "good first issue" and "help wanted" labeled github issues across all open-source `RTradeLtd` code-bases. The idea is by providing a central repository of information, it is easier for developers to find areas to contribute code via existing github issues. Additionally, if you are unsure where to submit a "feature request", this would be a good place to do it.

To view available issues, please see the corresponding github issue in this repository for a particular repository, such as `RTradeLtd/thc`

# Process For Taking An Issue And Working On It

* Make sure no one else is currently working on the issue. If someone has expressed interest, and after being engaged there is no response for 2 weeks, feel free to express your interest as well.
* Express your interest in working on a particular issue. To do this, please comment on the appropriate repository issue within `RTradeLtd/issues`, and also on the corresponding issue for whatever repository it applies to, such as `RTradeLtd/Pay`.
* If you don't need any guidance on work involved in an issue, feel free to get started right away
* If you do need some assistance, wait for a project maintainer to get back to you.
* All submissions MUST include tests, they will not be accepted otherwise

Priority for assigning issues (in case multiple people have expressed interest) are in the following order:
* RTrade employees (developers that are members of this github organization)
* Outside collaborators (anyone who is not a member of the github organization)
